      \item One year contract term with the possibility (likelihood) of renewal. This company builds enterprise level software for various clients from different industries (from banking, insurance to smart cities). I am currently integrated in a team that is developing from the ground up the system that will be used to manage the entire process of the newly formed TML (Transportes Metropolitanos de Lisboa) which is the conglomeration of the Lisbon (and surrounding areas) public subway, train and bus systems. I mainly work backend with Java and Spring Boot, but I also have fights with frontend (which is that stinking horrible malformity we call Angular) and some DevOps (which is Azure and Jenkins).

      This was rather annoying. This company is not bad, not at all, they are very good... Yet, the division which lured us in was specialized in ``the dark arts of Lying'', the call centre.
      They started to show us different roles and specialities, which we could have developed and worked long-term, in a daily cycle in the first two weeks and then told us the truth, a month of Call Center classes and a tiny bit of real work at the end.
